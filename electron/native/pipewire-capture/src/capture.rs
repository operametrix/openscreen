//! The video half of Stage 2: PipeWire frames in, MP4 on disk out.
//!
//! CONSTANT FRAME RATE, DRIVEN BY A CLOCK, NOT BY ARRIVALS.
//!
//! A compositor delivers frames on damage. Nothing moves on screen, no frames
//! arrive — mutter will happily go seconds without one while the user reads a
//! page. Writing one output frame per delivered frame would therefore produce a
//! file whose playback speed depends on how busy the screen was, which is not a
//! recording of anything.
//!
//! So the output rate comes from a monotonic clock instead. [`Capture::advance`]
//! asks what frame index the wall clock is on and stamps the staged picture with
//! THAT index as its PTS, holding the last picture across a gap. That is why
//! [`crate::encoder`] splits conversion from encoding: a held frame costs an
//! upload and an encode (1.4 ms here) but not the colour conversion (3.6 ms),
//! which is the expensive part.
//!
//! WALL-CLOCK PTS, NOT A FRAME COUNTER. The PTS is the clock's frame index, not
//! a running count of frames written — and the two stop agreeing the moment a
//! tick is missed. If the loop is starved under load, an encode runs long, or the
//! screen sits static between wakeups, the next write JUMPS its PTS to the real
//! index and the container stores the skipped slots as that frame's duration. So
//! the file's length always equals real elapsed time: a dropped frame becomes one
//! longer-held frame, never a deleted slice of the timeline. Encoding a running
//! counter instead silently time-compressed recordings under load and desynced
//! the screen from audio, webcam and the cursor overlay (issue #511). Playback is
//! variable-rate, which the editor and compositor already seek/play by decoded
//! PTS (the same path the webcam, itself VFR, has always taken).
//!
//! The clock is ours, not the compositor's. `SPA_META_Header.pts` is more precise
//! per frame, but pause/resume and the audio epoch all live on this process's
//! monotonic clock, and quantising to 1/fps makes the difference immaterial.
